# Physics Marks

# You can create histograms for these columns in a similar way.

Step 4: Bivariate Analysis
Explore relationships between columns using scatter plots for numerical variables and bar plots for categorical variables.

Step 5: Multivariate Analysis
Use techniques like heatmaps, pair plots, and factor plots to explore relationships between multiple variables.

Step 6: Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values, if any.
Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for "gender" and "has_part_time_job").
Step 7: Final Inferences and Insights
Summarize your findings and provide explanations based on your EDA. For example, you can analyze how gender relates to study hours and academic performance.

Step 8: Recommendations and Next Steps
Suggest potential actions or further analyses based on your findings, such as identifying factors that impact student performance.

Remember to replace "your-data-file.csv" with the actual path to your dataset, and adapt the code as needed to match your specific dataset and research questions.
